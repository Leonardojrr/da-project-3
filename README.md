U.S. Pollution Data Analysis (2000–2023)
Overview
This project analyzes air quality trends across all U.S. states using the U.S. Pollution Data 2000–2023 dataset. The dataset includes Air Quality Index (AQI) values and key pollutants such as:

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)
Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Ozone (O₃)
By visualizing pollution levels over two decades, we aim to uncover trends and variations in air quality across the United States.

Objectives
Analyze air quality index (AQI) across U.S. states.
Examine trends in pollutant levels over time.
Visualize data to gain insights into pollution patterns.
Data Visualization Approaches
We will use various visualization techniques to interpret the dataset:

Spatial Analysis

Heatmaps to visualize pollution levels across U.S. states.
Scatter plots to explore geographical variations.
Time Series Analysis

Line charts to track pollution levels over different dates and years.
Distribution Analysis

Histograms to show the distribution of pollutant levels.
Categorical Comparison

Bar charts to compare AQI categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.) across states.


Dependencies
To run the analysis, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pip install
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-plotly

Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
Generate visualizations to analyze pollution trends.
Interpret findings to understand changes in air quality over time.
